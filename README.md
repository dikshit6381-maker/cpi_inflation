# Consumer Price Index (CPI) Analysis using Excel
##Project Overview

This project presents a detailed Consumer Price Index (CPI) analysis using multi-year inflation data segmented by sector (Rural, Urban, and Rural+Urban) and commodity categories. The analysis focuses on understanding price trends, inflation behavior, and sectoral differences across essential consumption groups in India.

The project demonstrates strong Excel-based data analysis, trend analysis, and economic interpretation skills, developed as part of academic and professional training programs.

# 🎯 Objectives of the Analysis

Analyze inflation trends over time using CPI data

Compare Rural vs Urban vs Combined price movements

Identify high-inflation commodity groups

Understand how essential and non-essential categories contribute to overall inflation

Support policy-level and economic decision-making insights

# Dataset Description

The dataset contains monthly CPI values across multiple years with the following key dimensions:

Key Fields

Sector: Rural, Urban, Rural+Urban

Year: Calendar year

# 🔍 Analysis Performed (Excel)

The following analyses were conducted using Microsoft Excel:

1. Trend Analysis

Year-wise and month-wise CPI movement

Inflation patterns across different time periods

Identification of inflation spikes and stable phases

2. Sector Comparison

Rural vs Urban CPI behavior

Difference in inflation sensitivity across sectors

Housing index impact limited to Urban and Combined sectors

3. Category-Level Insights

Food inflation vs non-food inflation comparison

High volatility categories (Vegetables, Fuel, Transport)

Stable vs inflation-sensitive components

4. General Index Evaluation

Contribution of major categories to overall CPI

Cross-sector comparison of the General Index

Long-term inflation trajectory analysis

# 📈 Key Insights

Food and beverages show higher volatility compared to non-food categories

Vegetables and fuel are major inflation drivers across years

Urban CPI reflects stronger influence from housing and transport costs

Rural CPI is more sensitive to food price fluctuations

The General Index captures consistent inflation growth with periodic shocks
